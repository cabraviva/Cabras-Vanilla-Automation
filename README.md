# Cabra's Vanilla Automation
Hey there! This Cabra's Vanilla Automation, a datapack for minecraft, tested and working on **1.20.1**, which adds neat automation tweaks to minecraft while staying vanilla-friendly. I tried to extend vanilla mobs with cool automation functionality, some useful for every game, some for modded minecraft and some are just fun to play with. See the [Feature List](#feature) [FAQ](#FAQ)


## FAQ

### Where can I download the pack?
The latest zipped datapack file will be available for download at the [Releases](https://github.com/cabraviva/Cabras-Vanilla-Automation/releases) page. If you don't know how to install my pack, just watch a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=minecraft+install+datapack).

### Why a datapack?
I chose making this a datapack because I wanted these automation features to be easy to maintain and usable in every minecraft instance, no matter whether you are using forge, fabric or vanilla. Also, datapacks are serverside and no other player has to install it to work.
